# PY-DOS-on-ESP32
PY-DOS on ESP32 is a lightweight command-line OS ported to MicroPython. It runs on resource-limited ESP32 boards and provides a simple DOS-like experience via a serial terminal.

## Version Plan:
- One more update will be released for this repository within this month. This update marks the transition from a simple PY-DOS simulator to a fully working PY-DOS for ESP32.
- After version **1.0.5** (this repository is currently at **1.0.4**, as it continues from PY-DOS **1.0.3**), development will move to a new repository:  
  **[Espy32](https://github.com/EgeOnderX/Espy32)**
- In that repository, PY-DOS will evolve into a complete operating system for ESP32, written entirely in Python, capable of running Python scripts natively, and no longer a simulator.
